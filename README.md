- 👋 Hi, I’m @isaal1
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and would like to gain more experience working in the field. I'd love to work in the non-profit sector, fintech, and the beauty industry. I have previous experience in consumer analytics for a digital bank.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL. I am also doing a Data Analytics program at Trebas College.
- 📫 How to reach me: isa.ali0@icloud.com
- 😄 A little bit about me: Beyond my work experience, I also have a BA in Politics and Governance. I am part of the Ballroom community in Toronto, I am really passionate about Queer and Trans rights, and I enjoy going to drop in pottery workshops. I used to play rugby, and I am really passionate about the arts, specifically Musical Theatre. Also, I know this is controversial, but I like pineapples on my pizza 🍕.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Australia is wider than the moon.
